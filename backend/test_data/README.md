# Test Data

This directory contains test data fixtures for the Chaski application.

## Files

- `users.json` - Test users with different roles (admin, sender, courier, both)
- `packages.json` - Test packages with various statuses and sizes
- `courier_routes.json` - Test courier routes for matching packages
- `notifications.json` - Test notifications for common package lifecycle events
- `load_test_data.py` - Python script to load the test data into the database

## Loading Test Data

To load the test data into your database:

```bash
cd backend
python -m test_data.load_test_data
```

The script will:
1. Ask if you want to clear existing data
2. Create database tables if they don't exist
3. Load users (with hashed passwords)
4. Load packages and build a mapping of IDs
5. Load courier routes
6. Load notifications linked to users and packages

## Test User Credentials

After loading, you can use these credentials to log in:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| admin@chaski.com | admin123 | admin |
| john.sender@example.com | sender123 | sender |

## Data Relationships

- Packages reference users by `sender_id` and `courier_id`
- Courier routes reference users by `courier_id`
- User IDs start from 1 (admin) and increment sequentially

## Notes

- All coordinates are for locations in San Francisco, CA
- Passwords are stored in plain text in the JSON files but are hashed when loaded into the database
- The script uses the same password hashing function as the main application
- Timestamps are automatically generated by the database on creation
